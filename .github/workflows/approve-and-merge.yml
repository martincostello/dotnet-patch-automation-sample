# This workflow runs when a pull request is opened or updated, and checks if the pull
# request was opened by a user we trust to do automated changes, and if so, approves
# the pull request and enables auto-merge if it only updates the .NET SDK and
# Microsoft-published dependencies to the latest patch version for the current release.
#
# This workflow assumes that the following processes are in place to ensure that
# automatic merges with no human involvement are as safe as possible:
# - Pull requests require at least one approving review before merging;
# - Pull requests require at least one required status check to pass before merging;
# - The build workflow(s) run test(s) that provide adequate test coverage.
#
# If you need more than one reviewer or require CODEOWNERS approval, then this workflow
# will not be able to merge the pull request automatically without some human input.
#
# This workflow is based on the examples from the dependabot/fetch-metadata action:
# https://github.com/dependabot/fetch-metadata#auto-approving
# https://github.com/dependabot/fetch-metadata#enabling-auto-merge
